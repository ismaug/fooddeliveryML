# Model Explainability Analysis

## Linear Regression Coefficients

### Feature Importance Ranking
*[Add coefficient table with features ranked by absolute value]*

The linear model provides direct interpretability through coefficients:

**Top Predictive Features**:
1. **Distance_km**: +X.XX minutes per km
2. **Preparation_Time_min**: +X.XX minutes per prep minute  
3. **Weather_Rainy**: +X.XX minutes in rainy conditions
4. **Traffic_Level_High**: +X.XX minutes in high traffic

### Business Interpretation

**Distance Effect**: Each additional kilometer adds ~X minutes to delivery time. This creates a baseline prediction formula:
```
Base Time = X + (Distance × X.XX) + (Prep Time × X.XX)
```

**Weather Impact**: 
- Rainy weather: +X minutes average
- Clear weather: baseline (reference category)
- *[Add other weather effects]*

**Traffic Impact**:
- High traffic: +X minutes vs low traffic
- Medium traffic: +X minutes vs low traffic  
- Rush hour indicator: +X minutes during peak times

## Tree Model Feature Importance

### Random Forest Importance
*[Add feature importance chart from Random Forest model]*

Key findings from ensemble methods:
- **Distance remains dominant**: X% importance
- **Preparation time**: X% importance  
- **Experience effects**: X% importance
- **Interaction effects**: Limited significance

### XGBoost SHAP Analysis
*[Add SHAP summary plot and individual prediction explanations]*

SHAP values reveal:
- **Linear distance relationship**: No threshold effects detected
- **Weather interactions**: Minimal cross-feature dependencies
- **Traffic patterns**: Additive rather than multiplicative effects

## Feature Engineering Impact

### Distance Categories
- **Small deliveries** (≤5km): X% of orders, avg X minutes
- **Medium deliveries** (5-15km): X% of orders, avg X minutes  
- **Large deliveries** (>15km): X% of orders, avg X minutes

**Insight**: Categories didn't improve over continuous distance, indicating linear relationship.

### Rush Hour Analysis
- **Peak hours** (Morning/Evening): +X minutes average
- **Off-peak**: baseline performance
- **Effect size**: X% of total variance explained

## Model Limitations

### What the Model Captures Well
- Distance-based predictions (primary driver)
- Weather and traffic additive effects
- Preparation time impacts
- Vehicle type differences

### What It Misses
- **Seasonal variations**: Model doesn't account for holidays/events
- **Route complexity**: Assumes direct distance relationship  
- **Dynamic traffic**: Uses categorical rather than real-time data
- **Courier individual differences**: Experience as proxy only

## Confidence Intervals

### Prediction Reliability
*[Add prediction interval analysis]*

The model provides reliable predictions within:
- **±X minutes** for 68% of deliveries (1 std dev)
- **±X minutes** for 95% of deliveries (2 std dev)

### Uncertainty Sources
1. **Model uncertainty**: R² = 85.2% leaves 14.8% unexplained variance
2. **Feature noise**: Missing route details, real-time conditions
3. **Data limitations**: 794 training samples for generalization
